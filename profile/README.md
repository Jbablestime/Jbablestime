## Guten Tag! 👋🏻
How's it going? I'm Jonathan, or as you may know me as Jb. I'm a fullstack developer from Germany focused on software development and UX design. Over the 9+ years of experience as a developer, and around 7+ years of experience as a development freelancer/contractor, I've gained a suitable amount of knowledge in the field of software and web development. My main focus is producing free and open sourced software that can be used by anyone for whatever they may need.
