## Guten Tag! 👋🏻
Hey there, I'm Jonathan. I'm a Senior Software Engineer and UX Design student, always learning new ways to improve my programming skills. WIthin the last 7 years, I've excelled in the world of programming. I opened up to new stacks, learned new frameworks, and built websites and applications that represent these skillsets well. During the last 3 years, I've been super interested in Cyber Security. Being certified in CompTIA A+ and Security+, I've learned my fair-share about the depths of the internet and how to protect myself against it. I love coffee, Korey, and taking pictures of the world.
